# Accepts any number of room measurements, then calculates the total area. 
# It is assumed that
# * rooms only consist of right angles.
# * rooms only have 1 inward angle at most.
# 
# Basically, this program assumes rooms either look like this:
#
#  ________________
# |                |
# |                |
# |                |
# |________________|
#
# or like this:
#
#  _______
# |       |
# |       |________
# |                |
# |                |
# |________________|

# Make sure to run this in Python 3.
